# Description

SeeSay is a web-based platform for the distribution and sale of images. It's a place where photographers can share their creativity, and users can search and purchase unique images for their needs.

The [server-side](https://github.com/BnnQ/SeeSay) of SeeSay is written in **ASP.NET Core 7** (Web API), providing reliability and performance. The use of [microservices](https://github.com/BnnQ/SeeSayMicroservices) (**Azure Functions** written in .NET Core) allows for flexible scaling and optimization of various aspects of the platform. The client-side of the website is built with **Angular 16**, a popular and robust framework for creating dynamic and responsive web applications.

This combination of technologies makes SeeSay a powerful platform for both photographers and image seekers, offering a wide range of features and a user-friendly interface.
